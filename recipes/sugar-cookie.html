<h2>Sugar Cookie Frosting</h2>
<p>This sugar cookie frosting recipe made with shortening and confectioners' sugar has a lovely vanilla flavor. It's quick and easy to make and works well on both soft and crisp sugar cookies. It starts out soft and spreadable but firms up nicely for cookie stacking and storage. Divide the frosting into smaller bowls and use food coloring to tint as desired.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Â½ cup shortening</li>
    <li>4 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons milk, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or more to taste</li>
    <li>food coloring (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
